    <h2>🏃‍♂️ About Us 📘 </h2>
    <p><strong>GoRunSA</strong> is a proudly South African sport-tech platform created to unite and uplift the country’s running community. Whether you're an elite athlete, a weekend runner, a school coach, or a club administrator, GoRunSA is built with you in mind.</p>
    <p>We simplify how clubs manage memberships, how athletes get discovered, and how communities stay connected through the power of running. By combining technology with local insight, we’re building something far more than just an app we’re building a digital home for South African athletics.</p>
    <p><strong>GoRunSA</strong> was founded with a personal mission: to eliminate the barriers that stop young athletes from being seen and supported, and to reduce the overwhelming admin load placed on clubs and volunteers. With a growing passion for technology and sport, we’re creating tools that make running more accessible, rewarding, and impactful for all.</p>
